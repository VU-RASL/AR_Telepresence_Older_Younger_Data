Data corresponding to the manuscript titled 'Efficacy of Augmented Reality-Based Telepresence as a Medium for Interpersonal Communication among Older and Younger Adults'


The attached data file includes five sheets with relevant data that can be used to reproduce the results discussed in the paper. Below is a description of each sheet:

1. _EmotionRecognition_: This sheet includes eight columns. The first column labelled case ID enlists all the participants using their alphanumeric codes. YA = Younger Adults and OA= Older adults. The next column assigns number 1 to younger adults and the number 2 to older adults. The third column shows whether the participant was shown the videos first (1) or the avatar animations (1). The fourth column shows the stimulus through which the emotion shows in the sixth column was displayed. Column five shows the sequence number of that emotion. Column 7 shows how the emotion was identified by the participant identified by their case ID for that row and column 8 shows whether they got it correct or incorrect.
2. _RoseBudThornQuestionnaireYoung_: Each row of this sheet includes the case ID and the response of the younger participants associated to that case ID to the 8 different statements of the survey. These responses were collected from a 7-point Likert scale with 1 representing 'strong disagreement' and 7 representing 'strong agreement'. The statements were added to each column as S1,S2,S3... and so on and a lookup table was provided to see what statement each of these corresponded to. Statement 8 (S8) asked the participants for one word description of their experience and their responses were recorded in the column labelled 'S8'.
3. _RoseBudThornQuestionnaireOlder_: This sheet was structed the same way as the previous sheet but for older adults.
4. _Demographics_Young_: This sheet included the demographic information of the younger participants such as their age, gender, race, and ethnicity.
5. _Demographics_Old_: This sheet included the demographic information of the older participants such as their age, gender, race, and ethnicity.
